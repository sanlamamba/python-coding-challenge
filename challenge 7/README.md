DESC:
    Write a Python program that prints the string s without the character at index n.

    If the index n is out of range, print the string s intact.

    If the string s is empty, print the string s intact. 

EX:
    "HELLO", 1 -> "Hllo"
    "World", 3 -> "Word"
    "Dog", 15 -> "Dog"
    "", 2 -> ""
