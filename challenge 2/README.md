- Write a Python program that prints the character at index i in the string s.
- If the index is out of range, the program should print "i is out of range"
- If the string is empty, the program should print "Empty String"

example : 
            fun("HELLO","2") -> "L"
            fun("PIZZA", "4") -> "A"
            fun("","3") -> "Empty String"
            fun("WORLD", 15)  ->  "i is out of range"
