DESC:
    Write a Python program that prints the string s with the character curr_char replaced by the character new_char.

    curr_char and new_char are variables that contain strings with a single character.

    You may assume that new_char will not be an empty string.

    The match must be case-sensitive (do not replace lowercase letters if curr_char is uppercase).

    If no match is found, print the initial string. 

EX: 
    String      curr_char    new_char   output
    "Hello"      "l"           "s"      "Hesso"
    "World"      "W"            "A"     "Aorld"
    "Python"     "P"            'x"     "xython"
    "Python"     'p'            'a'     'Python'
